├── onedrive-service.js

```

## Next Steps

The migration is complete. You can now:

1. **Test Upload**: Use the dashboard to upload images, videos, or audio files
2. **Verify Storage**: Check that files are saved in the `uploads/` directory
3. **Test Gallery**: Ensure uploaded files display correctly in the media gallery
4. **Backup Setup**: Consider setting up regular backups of the `uploads/` directory

All functionality previously available with OneDrive is now working with local storage, with the added benefits of:
- No external API dependencies
- No authentication setup required
- Faster file access
- Full control over file storage
