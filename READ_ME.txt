Welcome to the first draft of the UW Stout Smart Art Database Website.
Currently the database is hosted on a protected server so there may be issues
viewing the full functionality of the Website from just the code.

Current functionality:
Users:
- able to create, update, and delete projects linked to their accounts.
- upload media and attach it to their projects.
- delete media that they have uploaded.

Admin:
- all standard user functionality.
- promote/demote user to (or from) Admin Status
- moderate projects (including deletion)
- moderate media (including deletion)
- view the database and run cleanup functions in case of orphaned files/entries
- create a backup of media for long term archieval preservation (including paths)

If the database can't be accessed, please see the DEMO IMAGES folder for an example
of the website functionality.
